# Personal Projects
This is a list of some personal projects I've done over the years.
This is a continous WIP. Many projects will not be listed.


## Projects

#### BFS/DFS Visualization

This is a simple random visualization for breadth-first and depth-first traversal on a graph where you can choose the number of nodes(n) and vertices(m).
To use this, clone BFS_DFS_Visualization.py and install networkx and matplotlib.pyplot.
This is best run in an IDE terminal where you can directly choose which search to use and change the value of G(n,m) to your liking.

The purpose of this project was to be more familiar with PyCharm and how it operates while learning some DSA.
